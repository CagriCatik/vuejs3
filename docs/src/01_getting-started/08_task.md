# Implementing a Full-Scale Project

## Overview:
In this assignment, you will be tasked with implementing a complete project using **Vue.js 3**. The project should showcase your understanding of Vue.js concepts such as **components**, **directives**, **routing**, and **project structure**. You will also incorporate Vue.js performance optimization techniques and ensure the project is well-organized and scalable.

---

# Project Requirements:

You are required to implement a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** that includes the following key features:

## 1. **Project Setup**
- Set up your Vue.js project using either **Vue CLI** or **Vite**.
- Use **Vue Router** for client-side routing to handle multiple views/pages.
- Include at least 3 main views/pages:
  - **Home Page**
  - **About Page**
  - **Contact Page**
- Install **Vuex** (optional) or manage state across components using the **Composition API** if the app requires global state management.

---

## 2. **Components**
- Create reusable **Vue components** for the different sections of your application.
  - Example components: `Navbar.vue`, `Footer.vue`, `Card.vue`, `Form.vue`, etc.
- Use **props** and **emits** to manage data flow between components.
  
### Tasks:
1. Implement a **navbar** and **footer** that are included in all views.
2. Create a reusable **card component** to display items or content dynamically.
3. Build a **form component** for handling user input on the Contact page, with form validation.

---

## 3. **Vue Directives**
- Utilize built-in Vue directives such as `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-model`, `v-bind`, and `v-on` where necessary.
- Implement at least one **custom directive**. For example:
  - A directive that automatically focuses on an input field when the page loads.
  - A directive that changes the background color of a component based on a condition.

### Tasks:
1. Use **v-if** and **v-for** in the views to conditionally render components and loop through data.
2. Implement a **custom directive** that enhances the user experience in one part of your application.

---

## 4. **Routing**
- Implement **Vue Router** for seamless navigation between pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
- Use **route parameters** and **lazy loading** to optimize the application.
- Handle **404 Not Found** pages with a custom error view.

### Tasks:
1. Create at least three main routes for your views: Home, About, and Contact.
2. Use **lazy loading** to load components only when needed.
3. Implement navigation guards (if applicable) to control access to certain pages (optional).

---

## 5. **Form Handling and Validation**
- On the **Contact Page**, create a form that allows users to submit their name, email, and a message.
- Use **v-model** for two-way binding of form inputs.
- Implement form validation to ensure that all fields are filled correctly before submission (e.g., email format validation).
- Provide feedback to the user (e.g., success message, error message) after form submission.

### Tasks:
1. Build a form using Vue.js components.
2. Use **v-model** for form data binding.
3. Implement **form validation** and ensure proper error handling and feedback.

---

## 6. **State Management (Optional)**
- If your application has global state requirements, implement **Vuex** or use the **Composition API** to manage state across different components.
- For example, if the user logs in or interacts with content that affects multiple views, manage this state globally.

### Tasks:
1. Use Vuex for centralized state management (optional).
2. Alternatively, use the Composition API to handle shared state across components.

---

## 7. **Project Structure**
- Follow best practices for **organizing your project**. Ensure that your components, views, and assets are organized in a logical manner.
  
### Suggested Structure:

```
my-vue-app/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── images/
│   │   └── styles/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Navbar.vue
│   │   ├── Footer.vue
│   │   └── Card.vue
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── Home.vue
│   │   ├── About.vue
│   │   └── Contact.vue
│   ├── router/
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── App.vue
│   └── main.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

---

## 8. **Performance Optimization**
- Optimize your application by using techniques like:
  - **Lazy loading** of components using Vue Router.
  - Using the **v-once** directive to prevent unnecessary re-renders of static content.
  - Implementing **key-based rendering** in lists using `v-for`.

### Tasks:
1. Ensure that large components are loaded lazily to reduce initial page load time.
2. Use **v-once** to prevent static components from re-rendering unnecessarily.

---

## 9. **Styling and Responsiveness**
- Ensure that your application is **fully responsive** and adapts well to different screen sizes.
- Use **CSS** or a **pre-processor** (like SCSS) to style your components.
- Consider using a **CSS framework** like Bootstrap or Tailwind for easier responsiveness (optional).

### Tasks:
1. Ensure that all views and components are responsive and mobile-friendly.
2. Implement consistent styling across all components and views.

---

## 10. **Deployment (Optional)**
- Deploy your Vue.js application to a platform like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**.
- Make sure that your deployed application is accessible and functional in a production environment.

### Tasks:
1. Deploy your application using Netlify, Vercel, or another platform of your choice.
2. Share the URL to your live application.

---

# Submission:
- Submit a **GitHub repository** with your project code.
- Ensure the repository includes a **README** file explaining how to set up and run the project, including a brief description of the project’s features.
- (Optional) Share the **live URL** if the project is deployed online.

# Evaluation Criteria:
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured, clean, and readable code.
- **Component Reusability**: Efficient use of Vue components with clear separation of concerns.
- **Directives Usage**: Correct usage of built-in and custom directives.
- **Routing and Navigation**: Smooth navigation between views with proper route handling.
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient use of lazy loading, key-based rendering, and static content rendering.
- **Responsiveness**: The application should be fully responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes.
- **Form Handling**: Proper implementation of form data handling and validation.
